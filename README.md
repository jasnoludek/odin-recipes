# odin-recipes
This is the first assignment in the Odin Project Foundations Course.
I will be putting to use the skills learned up to this point,
including using the terminal to create directories and files, 
HTML boilerplate, and HTML headers and tags, including links and images.
In this project my goal is to become confident in writing meaningful
and well-timed commit messages.

Reflections after completing the assignment.
It was fairly simple and straight-forward, using elementary HTML. 
One interesting note - these recipes were given to me personally,
and not sourced online. I experimented with BlueWillow AI to see
how well it could generate images of these dishes, since I didn't
have my own photos. It's definitely far from perfect. Some of the
images it generated were even hilarious. Others, creepy.
