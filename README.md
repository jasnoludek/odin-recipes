# odin-recipes
This is the first assignment in the Odin Project Foundations Course.
I will be putting to use the skills learned up to this point,
including using the terminal to create directories and files, 
HTML boilerplate, and HTML headers and tags, including links and images.
In this project my goal is to become confident in writing meaningful
and well-timed commit messages.
