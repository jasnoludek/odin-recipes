            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the early potatoes and rinse them under cold water. Place them in a pot, cover them with water and bring to a boil. Cook until softened, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Clean and wash the chicken breasts. In a shallow dish, beat one egg. In another shallow dish, mix together the bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Dip each chicken breast in the <br> beaten egg, then coat it in the bread crumbs mixture.</li>
                <li>In a large pan, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 5-7 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them and place them on a serving dish. Sprinkle fresh dill over the top.</li>
                <li>Place the cooked chicken breasts on the same serving dish as the potatoes.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
